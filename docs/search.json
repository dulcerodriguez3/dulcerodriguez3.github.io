    "text": "Housing Crisis through Time Series\n\nThis project investigates monthly U.S. housing starts from 1965 to 1975, applying time series analysis techniques to understand and predict future activity. After splitting the data, I used transformations (Box-Cox) and differencing to address non constant variance and seasonality. I then examined ACF/PACF plots for our model selection. Among several candidate ARIMA/SARIMA models, a seasonal ARIMA with Box-Cox transformation provided the best fit based on AICc and residual diagnostics. The resulting forecasts suggest relatively stable future housing starts with widening uncertainty over time. This shows how a standard time series methods can provide practical insights into housing market trends. This project was developed using R studio, markdown. .\n\nAmazon Product Recommendation system\n\nIn this project, we developed a recommendation system using an Amazon dataset to enhance user experience by providing personalized product recommendations. With the vast amount of data available in e-commerce, recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users discover relevant products efficiently. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that predicts user preferences based on historical interactions and product attributes. This project was developed using Python and Quarto, R studio.\n\nWorld Happiness by GDP Report and App\n\n\nThis project aims to analyze World Happiness Report 2023 data to determine if the mean “happiness” of a country is significantly different and changes over time differently in countries with a low versus high log GDP per capita. Linear regression models and exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to answer these questions. The results suggests that countries with a high GDP have overall higher Life ladder scores and positive affect scores than countries with a low GDP, but the trends over time show unexpected peaks where this gap is bridged. Overall, analyzing world happiness report data can help identify important characteristics of a country that keep citizens happy. In addition, I was able to generate a Shiny App that showcase interesting aspect and the findings while keeping it interactive. The app includes PCA-related analyses and is a visualizations-based app, allowing the user to add aesthetics to encode additional information on variables.\n\n\nPortfolio Website\n\nA personal portfolio website highlighting projects and achievements, designed with Quarto and hosted on GitHub Pages."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Dulce Rodriguez! I’m a fourth‑year Statistics & Data Science major with a minor in Technology Management at UC Santa Barbara and a proud first‑generation student from Central California. I love turning messy data into clear, actionable stories—whether I’m building predictive models at UBS Investment Bank, crunching performance stats for UCSB Men’s Soccer, or exploring elliptic curves in my directed research. Fluent in Python, R, SQL, Tableau (and Spanish!), I thrive on collaboration, problem‑solving, and continuous learning. When I’m not buried in code or crafting visualizations, you’ll find me strolling the beach, cheering on the Gauchos, or attempting to teach my cat how to fetch. Welcome to my data driven corner of the internet!"
