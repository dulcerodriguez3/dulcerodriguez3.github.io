Hi, I’m Dulce Rodriguez! I’m a fourth‑year Statistics & Data Science major with a minor in Technology Management at UC Santa Barbara and a proud first‑generation student from Central California. I love turning messy data into clear, actionable stories—whether I’m building predictive models at UBS Investment Bank, crunching performance stats for UCSB Men’s Soccer, or exploring elliptic curves in my directed research. Fluent in Python, R, SQL, Tableau (and Spanish!), I thrive on collaboration, problem‑solving, and continuous learning. When I’m not buried in code or crafting visualizations, you’ll find me strolling the beach, cheering on the Gauchos, or attempting to teach my cat how to fetch. Welcome to my data‑driven corner of the internet!
